### Dissertation: Examining the Alignment of Automated Health Systems with Behavioural Change Theory
**Overview:** 

Sedentary behaviour (SB) and physical activity (PA) among young office workers is a growing concern with implications for both health and productivity. Mobile health               (mHealth) applications offer innovative avenues for interventions, whilst gamification enhances user engagement and motivation whilst aligning with behavioural                     change theory. This study delves into the emerging trend of automated goal setting to determine its compatibility with prominent behavioural change theories.

## Journey

I have an unusual path to programing. I have always been passionate about health, sports and fitness, which lead to complete my BSc. Sports and Exercise Science, before persuing a career as a PE Teacher. I spent 6 years in education and I loved the impact I could have as a teacher and the opportunity to promote what I am passionate about. My transition to teachnology began during the COVID-19 lockdowns, when PE changed completely. Lessons had been transformed from this fun, engaging, interactive sports hall to a remote, distant and awkward online setting - Yet I saw this as an opportunity to innovate and increase the access and diversity of the PE curriculum. I was invigorated by the opportunity to combine technology to promote health and exercise virtually and my first rudimentary project was a gamified HCI-project based around Temple Run. The feedback and success of this project illustrated to me that my impact as a PE Teacher was limited to my school and if I really wanted to create impactful solutions I needed to scale and personalise to each individual. This was my motivation behind completing my MSc Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science, and I am very excited to combine my teaching and exercise background with my applied artificial intelligence skillset.
