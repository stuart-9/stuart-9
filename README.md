### Dissertation: Examining the Alignment of Automated Health Systems with Behavioural Change Theory
**Overview:** 

Sedentary behaviour (SB) and physical activity (PA) among young office workers is a growing concern with implications for both health and productivity. Mobile health               (mHealth) applications offer innovative avenues for interventions, whilst gamification enhances user engagement and motivation whilst aligning with behavioural                     change theory. This study delves into the emerging trend of automated goal setting to determine its compatibility with prominent behavioural change theories.

### Heart Disease Predictor
**Overview:** 
The project ivolved the use of data from The University of California Irvine Heart Disease Dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted and relevent continuous data was encoded before investigating the distribution of data and normalised accordingly. Training and test datasets were created and implemented with Logistic regression and KNN algorithms. Results indicate that whilst both methods display high accuracy on the dataset, Logistic Regression performs slightly better.

### Customer Segmentation Model
**Overview:** 
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted on the dataset to investigate any distribution or inclusion bias within the data, with appropriate data encoded to ensure better understanding by the model. Data was then normalised and focus turned to model development. WCSS was used to identify the optimal number of clusters within the dataframe. With visual aid from an elbow plot this was identified to be (n=4). This was fed into the K-Means Model and deployed. Results indicated that:
  - There appears a definite age split in this data. Young men and women have higher spending scores so the focus should be on attracting these customers.

  - Given the fewest participants are men and they have the highest spending score this should be prioritized.

  - Young women have the second highest spending scores but are already the most frequent visitors to the mall and steps should be taken to encourage this.

  - Older women are the second most frequent visitors to the mall so steps should be taken to target these

## Journey

I have an unusual path to programing. I have always been passionate about health, sports and fitness, which lead to complete my BSc. Sports and Exercise Science, before persuing a career as a PE Teacher. I spent 6 years in education and I loved the impact I could have as a teacher and the opportunity to promote what I am passionate about. My transition to teachnology began during the COVID-19 lockdowns, when PE changed completely. Lessons had been transformed from this fun, engaging, interactive sports hall to a remote, distant and awkward online setting - Yet I saw this as an opportunity to innovate and increase the access and diversity of the PE curriculum. I was invigorated by the opportunity to combine technology to promote health and exercise virtually and my first rudimentary project was a gamified HCI-project based around Temple Run. The feedback and success of this project illustrated to me that my impact as a PE Teacher was limited to my school and if I really wanted to create impactful solutions I needed to scale and personalise to each individual. This was my motivation behind completing my MSc Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science, and I am very excited to combine my teaching and exercise background with my applied artificial intelligence skillset.
